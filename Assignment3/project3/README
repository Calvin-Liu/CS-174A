I'll address each of the points in the spec briefly.

1. Getting a WebGL canvas to display is trivial now.

2. I used the code in the book to generate the spheres (tetrahedron method).
   The parameter used to control the number of vertices is
   numTimesToSubdivide.

3. In the tetrahedron recursion, I also generate normals for the spheres.
   Based on the type of shading for the planet, I generate either flat or
   smooth normals.

4. This is done by drawing multiple spheres and then applying the correct
   transformation matrices to make it appear as a solar system. Each of my
   planets orbit the sun at a different rate. I use a perspective projection.

5. To implement the sun as a point light source I specify the lightPosition
   as the center of the sun. For each of the planets, I specify a
   numTimesToSubdivide, calculate the correct normals, and specify all of the
   variables involved in calculating the shading for the planet, such as
   the ambientProduct and diffuseProduct. All the differences in the planets
   can be achieved by changing one or more of the above conditions.

6. Moved over the code from project 2 with some adjustments. My pitch is a
   little off I think, but since this portion of the assignment is only 10
   points I decided to shift my focus towards the shading aspect. Because
   the pitch is strange, my initial view isn't at a 30 degree angle.

7. I implemented the Gouraud shading in the vertex shader since it's a 
   per vertex shading method. I implemented Phong shading in the fragment
   shader because it's a per fragment shading method. I pass in a variable
   to my shaders called shadeType to specify which shading method to use
   based on the planet.

EXTRA CREDIT

1. I added a moon orbiting the last planet in my solar system. It's a goldish
   color and fairly small compared to the other objects in the solar system.
   To implement the moon, I just created a long series of transformations an
   instanced another sphere.

2. Didn't do.
